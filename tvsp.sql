This is because Konoha nearly destroyed the Sky Country during the last Shinobi World War. However, they survived and now are after Konoha and the Fire Country for revenge.\n\nThe group starts attacking Konoha causing mass mayhem, with flying ninjas on winged-mechanical devices bombarding the village. A boy comes all the way to inform Konoha that his village had been attacked and he was looking for his sensei, who was currently in Konoha, to go with him to heal the injured at his village.\n\nA 3 man team consisting of Naruto, Sakura and Hinata are sent along to help the boy''s village and they accompany Amaru, the boy and Shinnou his sensei back to the village. The team travel through a forest full of eerie beasts and poisonous animals by small rowing boats down a river. A Sora-Nin suddenly appears and they hide by the riverside with Naruto and Amaru hiding underwater until the Sora-Nin goes. When they resurface, Amaru gets caught in the weeds underwater and loses his precious scalpel (a present from his beloved sensei). While helping Amaru with the weeds, Naruto notices that Amaru is in fact a "she" due to her breasts present. Naruto blushes while at the same time, a poisonous piranha-like fish bites him and he faints. Later on, Naruto wakes up still blushing, also because Amaru was sucking the poisonous blood out of the wound on his thigh thus saving Naruto. Naruto asks her if he''s a "she" and suggests that Amaru has feelings for her sensei and he gets slapped.\n\nMeanwhile at Konoha, the Sora-nin retreats because they were out of chakra to maintain flying, so Konoha sends another special team to look for their base. Sai approaches the ships which is near the beach on one of his ink birds to attract attention while Shikamaru and Kakashi hides behind some rocks near the shore waiting for the right time to infiltrate and attack. At Orochimaru''s lair, Orochimaru is now ill because the body transfer jutsu he uses is close to expiration. Kabuto is attending to him and tells Sasuke that the Sora-nin is attacking Konoha to which Sasuke gives an "I don''t care" reply. Orochimaru orders Sasuke to get a man who is able to help him perfect his reincarnation jutsu.\n\nNaruto and company finally reach Amaru''s village to find that the village had been badly attacked and some parts are now in ruins with the inhabitants nowhere to be seen. Amaru cries and runs around trying to find some villages she unknowingly triggered a trap with a bunch of kunai flying towards her, her sensei Shinnou steps in and protects her but fails. Naruto, Sakura and Hinata run to the scene but it was too late, Shinnou dies. After Amaru comes to her senses they continue to look for villages. Sasuke is on his way to the village.\n\nLater on through a series of events Hinata gets separated from Sakura and Naruto. Naruto and Sakura find themselves in front of an evil monster that claims to be a bijuu, the Zero Tails, who feeds on the darkness of human souls and somehow took over Amaru. Sakura proves to be no match for the beast, the creature senses that Naruto has a huge dark energy/power inside of him so it taunts Naruto and tries to make him use that power, saying "He cannot save anyone without it" this makes Naruto remember about his failure in saving Sasuke and is emotionally unstable taking on the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox form, eventually the four tails state. After fighting for a while, he turns back to normal when the seal which Jiraiya gave to Naruto activates and removes Kyuubi''s chakra.\n\nNaruto tells Amaru to ignore the darkness in her heart which finally resulted in the beast getting defeated. Sakura wakes up in Naruto''s arms and punches him - awkwardly. They decided to separate with Naruto going on to look for the villagers and Hinata and Sakura going back to get help. Amaru, who was supposed to go with Sakura stays to help Naruto. They then found some old ruins in which Shinnou mentioned earlier and enters the ruins. Shinnou is inside - safe and sound saying something about conquering the world with the power of darkness. Amaru, excited that her sensei is alive runs to hug him, Naruto notices something''s not right and Shinnou laughs at Amaru for trusting him. Shinnou tells that he''s been researching on the power of darkness for about 15 years and he''s finally found it in Konoha now he only needs secret scroll with a reincarnation jutsu or something written on it. He then tranforms with his hair standing up and some physical changes in him. Naruto charges towards him only to be outmatched again and again, beating Naruto badly.\n\nShinnou also tries to convince Naruto to use the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox''s chakra. Amaru cries while Shinnou and Naruto duke it out. When she was small, she suffered from a strange illness. No one liked her, fearing that they''ll be infected. Only Shinnou cared for her and managed to cure her. Naruto tells her not to throw her feelings away while the evil Shinnou mocks her. She finally admits her love and feelings to Shinnou, causing him to laugh and allowing Naruto to land a hit. Naruto then manages to gain the upperhand in the fight.He was about to finish him off with resagen when sasuke appears and intervenes with naruto''s resagen. Saskue than says "Orochimaru needs help with a reincarnation jutsu" to Shinnou and Shinnou gives him a scroll. At first Shinnou refuses to do anything and tries to defeat Sasuke with dark charkra. Sasuke then reveals he attacked with Chidori Senbon early while fighting Naruto which attacks Shinnou''s cells and cut off his chakra flow. This has a side effect of turning Shinnou back to normal ,who then flees the scene and Sasuke after him. Naruto tells Amaru to go find the villagers while he goes after Sasuke. He finds Sasuke in a room and asks him "What are you doing here?". In the same room is a cocoon which is absorbing dark chakra, Shinnou fuses with the cocoon and attacks Naruto and Sasuke with tentacle arms and captures them. Shinnou tries to absorb their chakra, Sasuke turns to Curse Seal level 1 and releases evil chakra and Naruto who got Sasuke''s plan turns to his Nine-Tailed Demon Fox form sending a lot of chakra. After Naruto breaks free he makes kyuubi chakra-infused rasengan and attacks. The cocoon creature puts up a shield which Naruto and him reach a stalement. The kyuubi chakra cut Sasukes restraints and he then ascends to Curse Seal Level 2. and cuts down the shield thus allowing Naruto to finish off the creature with rasengan. After that he and Sasuke escape.\n\nIn the meantime, Konoha successfully infiltrates the Sora-nin''s base. Amaru finds Hinata and the villagers in a cell and frees them all and going off in lifeboats. Naruto appears again and orders Amaru to go, she refuses and Sasuke throws her in by force. As the lifeboat leaves tentacles reach to grab it but saskue cuts it down. Naruto smiles, and also forces Sasuke onto the lifeboat with Rasengan (Naruto whispers something to Sasuke) who then escapes. Remembering Jiraiya once said that Naruto had the willpower to never give up, he creates some shadow clones and start to destroy the ruins. When all was destroyed, he collapsed. Amaru, from a distance, sees Naruto and grabs a pair of Sora-nin wings and goes towards him. Upon reaching him, she grabs him and they fall together. Jiraiya suddenly pops out with Gamabunta and catches the two, thus saving them.\n\nLater on, Naruto wakes up in Amaru''s arms. Sasuke goes back and gives Orochimaru the scroll, who then asks if something good had happened. Sasuke then goes off to train and remembers Naruto''s whisper, "I''ll definitely bring you back to Konoha, Sasuke!"', 0, 7.5, 2, 0, 'Junki Takegami', 0, 'episodes/79824/583911.jpg', 1308358547, 27223, 79824, 1334170494),

They try to call the MPC and apparently send him to the 60s, but the MPC escapes out of the phone (being a literal cell phone with arms and legs) and begins dialing himself. Mordecai and Rigby escape with a golf cart, with the MPC hot on their track. They are called again by the MPC, who says that the 80s still wanted their phones back, to which Mordecai and Rigby are instantly dressed in 80s apparel to their grave horror. They get a second call to which Rigby begs him to leave them alone, only to get dressed in heavier apparel along with Mordecai, whom desperately tells Rigby to call someone...\n\n...who turns out to be Pops, Skips, and Benson in the present time. Rigby explains the situation to Pops, who passes it onto Benson, who hears about the problem. He thinks it''s a prank, and from this, all three are transported to 1982 and reappear on the back seat of the golf cart. The MPC appears right by the five in a limo, even attacking them by running into their side. Skips instructs Mordecai to hold the wheel steady, as he leaps onto the MPC''s limo, and later on claims its utter destruction. The MPC breaks out still, as the five run directly into an electronics store. Mordecai hatches a plan using a tape recorder...\n\nEveryone runs back and hides in the bushes as the MPC calls. Mordecai''s recording plays, keeping on saying things like, "Hello?" as if no one was there. This angers the MPC, whom reappears and finds out he was pranked. While he cries out, he is ambushed by everyone. Despite his struggles, the MPC cannot break free. Mordecai finally instructs Rigby to hit the power button. Rigby scurries up the MPC and pushes the power button, and the MPC, powerless, falls to the ground. Moments after Mordecai and Rigby celebrate their title, a bright light protrudes from the MPC, which Mordecai claims is the way out.\n\nThe five find themselves in a long hallway full of doors leading to certain years. After a while of searching, Benson finally finds the door leading to the present time. The MPC gets their attention, being old and wrinkly. He pleads for Mordecai and Rigby to take him with them, which they accept to do.\n\nIn the end, all three prank Benson, transporting the chair he was sitting on back to the 70''s.', 109, 8.4, 5, 1, '', 0, 'episodes/188401/2769041.jpg', 1304169534, 311571, 188401, 1334170699),

Benson says that the park is being audited because Pops tried to pay the park''s taxes with lollipops. After supposedly firing Muscle Man for not taking the situation seriously, Mordecai offers a suggestion; Rigby''s accountant brother, Don. Rigby dislikes Don because Don stole all the attention from Rigby on Rigby''s sixth birthday party. Despite Rigby''s objections, Mordecai brings Don to the park, where he immediately takes the attention from everybody because he is cool, nice, funny, and the total opposite of Rigby, and also because he gives a hug/hand-shake thing he calls "sugar". Rigby''s hatred for Don however grows, and it goes far enough that he mocks Don and throws a football in Mordecai''s stomach when he was hanging out with Don. Eventually, when Don is almost finished with the taxes, Rigby drives Don away after saying that Don should never have been born. Mordecai finds out and tells Rigby to bring Don back, but Rigby refuses to and says he can finish the audit by himself. However, he does it wrongly, and the park begins to disappear by the audit. Benson and the others try to get Rigby to bring Don back, but Rigby''s frustration is too big. Mordecai tells Rigby that although he doesn''t have a brother, he believes Rigby is his brother, despite how annoying and immature he can be. This gets Rigby to go with Mordecai to Don''s house in order to bring Don back, but Don is too sad to go back. But Rigby explains that the reason he hates Don is because ever since they were kids, Don managed to take Rigby''s friends away from him unintentionably because he was so cool, which drove Rigby to be heartbroken. Don apologizes for taking Rigby''s friends from him, and explains he was just trying to be a follower of Rigby, because he believed everything Rigby did was so cool, but everyone just thought these were Don''s ideas and that Rigby was his little brother, but it was the exact opposite. With Rigby and Don''s relationship better, they go back to the park in order to stop the audit. Don is almost finished with the audit, but says that Rigby still needs to give him some sugar, so Rigby reluctantly does so under pressure. The park is restored to normal, and Don says good-bye, saying his work as an accountant is never done. Rigby and Don are now on better terms with each other, and Mordecai tries to offer Rigby sugar, but Rigby pushes Mordecai aside.', 110, 8, 5, 1, '', 0, 'episodes/188401/2769051.jpg', 1304169574, 311571, 188401, 1334170700),

In the woods Rigby is holding the cake and his stomach start to growl Mordecai said don''t touch the cake but Rigby said it a medical emergency but Mordecai said he always ate a sandwich then Rigby ask Mordecai is he a doctor now and go to medical school in the past 5 minutes then Mordecai said they are saving for the party and took the cake away. At Skips house Benson ask Pops if they are there yet Pops said no then Benson said to turn off the light because it is almost 8:00 then when the lights turn off Muscle Man got undress but Benson said it not a naked party. Then back to the woods Rigby said that it is almost 8:00 and they not going find Skips in time and they should eat the cake but Mordecai said that Benson will get pissed then Rigby said that Benson will get like that no matter what and have its better to have no regrets and took the cake and about to eat it then Mordecai took the cake and Rigby jump on top on him to get the cake but Mordecai punch him and started to run then Rigby trips Mordecai buy holding both of his legs and he let go of the cake and Rigby caught then Mordecai jump on him and told to quit it because he is messing up the cake. Then they heard a strange noise and they find Skips doing an ancient ritual of some kind in the middle of the woods. When Rigby startles Skips, a ghost named Gary (perhaps singer David Bowie) picks up Skips in his car and takes him away, but Mordecai and Rigby manage to stow on. Skips was performing an ancient eternal youth dance and is presented by baby gods who are angry with Skips for not completing the dance that begin stealing his life and disintegrating into dust, and in order to save him, Mordecai found out that the baby gods love cake and then he offer their chocolate cake in exchange for Skips'' life, but at first Rigby ask him what is he doing then Mordecai ask him if he want Skips to die on his birthday then Rigby agrees which the gods bathe themselves in. Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips are sent back and Skipsâ€™ birthday party starts. They give Skips their plate as a birthday present and Pops was able to get a spare cake, but unfortunately for the duo, the cake is vanilla with chocolate frosting.', 106, 8.8, 4, 1, '', 0, 'episodes/188401/2888801.jpg', 1301144282, 311571, 188401, 1334170697),

Benson comes in and says that it was his grilled cheese sandwich. Rigby tries to lie to Benson, but Benson didn''t believe the story, and orders Mordecai & Rigby to get off their "lazy butts" and go get him another one. The duo find themselves in a long line to the a restaurant called Cheezers. They argue about who is the better liar. After Mordecai punches Rigby in the stomach, two astronauts in blue jackets goes around the line and enter the restaurant. Rigby recovers from the punch and teases Mordecai, touching his face and it pressured him into lying that they''re astronauts too. They enter the place and got a grilled cheese, but then Rigby goes to the real astronauts and tells them that Mordecai is his captain. Mordecai quickly tells the astronauts that they have to go back to the compound. One of them offers a ride while the other realizes that he never seen them before. Rigby explains that they got back from a ten year space trip and Mordecai includes that they got transferred. The astronauts decide to give them a ride and a tour of the compound. After entering the compound, Mordecai and Rigby say that they forgot their I.D. The astronauts let them use their I.D.s and gives them a blue space jacket. Rigby puts the grilled cheese in his jacket and tells the astronauts that Mordecai wants his in pink. Mordecai then explains that he borrowed a pair from Dr. Askovich (who was standing in front of them). She says that she doesn''t remember Mordecai who tries to remind her of the conference. She then looks uneasy and runs away. A montage of Mordecai and Rigby getting a tour while making the astronauts laugh with their lies played, and the group make a last stop at the Anti-Matter Chamber. One of the astronauts greets the only scientist named Jimmy then jokes that he can''t understand what these scientists say. Rigby tells another lie, saying that Mordecai knows about anti-matter. Mordecai tries to tell the astronauts that Rigby knows more which leads to an argument about who knows more while a alarm sound is going off. Jimmy explains that he''s having trouble with the anti-matter and is interrupted when an astronaut tells Mordecai and Rigby to help. After messing around with the buttons, Major Williams comes and yells at them. The alarm becomes louder as the anti-matter becomes unstable. The astronauts put Mordecai and Rigby into the chamber so they can fix it. They argue about whose fault it is, so Mordecai lies to the astronauts that he has a condition which makes him forget things in stress and that Rigby is an idiot. Jimmy explains that they have to throw a solid into the ant-matter. The astronauts tell Mordecai to throw Rigby into the anti-nucleus. Mordecai grabs Rigby (who''s crying), but takes the grilled cheese and throws it into the anti-nucleus. The anti-matter explodes and becomes stable, causing Mordecai and Rigby to slam into the door. When everybody came to them, Rigby tells them that they''re not astronauts. The astronauts throw them outside and threatened them. Mordecai and Rigby returned to Benson who questioned about what happened to his grilled cheese (which is burned up). Rigby tries to explain the truth, but Benson believes Mordecai who lied that they accidentally ran over it.', 107, 9.3, 4, 1, '', 0, 'episodes/188401/2888811.jpg', 1304169359, 311571, 188401, 1334170698),

Mordecai is swooned by her, but Rigby tells him that she means nothing. Just then, the TV shows a commercial for a cologne that can attract women, called "DudeTime".\nMordecai decides to get the cologne, but Rigby refuses to let him get it because they are supposed to play Strong Johns (a new video game) together. After having an argument, Mordecai decides to buy the cologne, and puts it on in the park. Rigby comes and tells Mordecai that it''ll never work (which was proved when Pops appears, but runs away from the smell of the cologne). After Mordecai puts on the cologne some more, a bunch of frat-boy Unicorns come and explain why they came. They tell him "you don''t use Dudetime to get the ladies, you use it to hang out with the bros!"\n\nMordecai becomes disappointed, but the leader of the Unicorns tells Mordecai that he''s "Pretty cool for letting [them] bum some of [his] Dudetime," and agree to help him attract Margaret. They first prank Mordecai by making him drink unicorn "slump," but tell him they were just having a little fun. Rigby agrees with them, but then Mordecai punches him and the two begin to fight. The unicorns break them up, and said that they won''t pull pranks on Mordecai. They then told Mordecai to gel his hair back, and "Lay it down" for Margaret. He goes into the coffee shop and tells Margaret "I''m here to... lay it down." She just gets confused, and Mordecai leaves the coffee shop, worse off than before.\n\nThe Unicorns say the solution to the problem is "Partying at your place!." They have a keg party at the golf course. Inside the house, one of the unicorns pushes Mordecai down. Rigby pretends to help him,but psyches him out at the last minute, saying "Why don''t you ask Margaret to help you?" Mordecai had enough, and told Rigby to had fun with his new "friends," because Benson will fire Rigby when he finds out about the party. Mordecai then walk out and leaves and Rigby to deal with his new "friends." During the party, Rigby finds Benson tied up and angry, and one of the Unicorns eats his gumballs. Another unicorn then destroys Rigby''s bed (which is a small trampoline).\n\nRigby goes to Mordecai and begs for help, but Mordecai tells him to ask his new "friends" for help. Then Rigby said that if they played the video game earlier, none of it this would have happened. Mordecai said that he was sorry about the video game, but that it doesn''t give Rigby the right to treat him like garbage. Rigby apologized to him numerous times, and was on the brink of tears by the end, asking if that was what he wanted to hear. "I miss you!" Rigby yelled to him. Mordecai finally agreed to help him. They went to Skips, who already knew about the Unicorn problem (because they peed on his lawn) and he agrees to help them. He tells Mordecai and Rigby that there''s one thing Unicorns never say no to: Drag Racing.\n\nThey host a drag race, with the unicorns in a Top-Fuel Dragster, and Mordecai and Rigby driving the golf-cart. As the race begins, the unicorns speed away. Skips press a button which releases a ramp into the Unicorn''s path, which sends them flying into the sky. Benson then presses another button, which blows up the Unicorns''s car, and explains that it''s the only way to get rid of them. He then hoses Mordecai and Rigby down, and orders them to clean up all the mess, or he''ll make them wish they were the ones driving the Unicorns'' car. He then tells Mordecai to quit spraying that cologne, and it won''t get him any ladies.

Pops made pies and Skips made chili, and Benson ordered premium hot dogs from the Internet. He tells Rigby not to grill them yet, but Rigby tells Mordecai that that they can. After using too much lighter fluid, though, Rigby burns the hot dogs, setting the grill on fire in the process. They push it into the river, putting out the fire, but causing all of the hot dogs to float away. Mordecai dramatically crosses his arms because he sick of Rigby getting him into trouble, much to Rigby''s dismay, and says "you pissed me off." Rigby tells Mordecai he can "fix it" (a line repeated by Rigby many times throughout this episode.) They go to get substitute hot dogs in the meat locker to fix the problem, with Rigby saying "Benson will never know."\nWhen they try to find the hot dogs, Rigby tries to help Mordecai look for them, even though he was supposed to be holding the door open. He props the door open with some bags of ice, which proceed to fall out of place, causing the door to slam shut. Rigby again tells Mordecai he can "fix it," but simply ends up breaking the safety latch off of the door by forcing it, notifying that the two are officially locked in the cellar. They pound on the door and yell for help, but Benson, Pops, and Skips are too busy with the party to hear them. Mordecai gets even more mad at Rigby, and tries to find a way to get out of the meat locker "before [they] both freeze to death." Rigby tells Mordecai he "found the thermostat," and "can totally fix it." He hits a duct with a frozen drumstick, causing the temperature to drop severely. Mordecai snaps and yells at Rigby that he can''t fix anything. He then crosses his arms again, and Rigby protests, yelling "Mordecai, don''t die mad at me!"\n\n" Too... late..." says Mordecai, and goes unconscious, falling to the floor. Rigby goes to Mordecai and starts to touch his face to see if he was okay, but Mordecai doesn''t respond. Rigby starts to feel guilty, and not going to abandon his best friend he grab a hold of Mordecai''s legs put on his shoulder and Rigby said he is going to take care of us.Then while Rigby looking for the hot dogs he look from boxes but didnt find them and he pick up Mordecai''s ankles and walk off. Then he is walking and holding him by his neck then Mordecai''s body is push off some of boxes by Rigby. After awhile of carrying Mordecai chest, he carefully move Mordecai''s head like a puppet and preneted he was telling he was doing alright but then he grows weak and drops Mordecai''s body and falls, hitting his head on a box which turn out to hold the hot dogs he was looking for. Then Rigby finds the hot dogs and discovers that they can talk. While Rigby was talking to the hot dogs, Mordecai dreams of Margaret, but it turns into a nightmare when Rigby appears as a giant. When Mordecai wakes up, Rigby explains the hot dogs and said while he was dead (unconscious) he found the hot dogs and they going to help them and they know a way out. The talking hot dogs tell Rigby if he can take them to a barbecue, (because it is their destiny to be eaten) that they can guide the two out of the meat locker. They make the deal, and a cooler appears, which teleports them back to the park.\n\nThe others come out, just in time for Benson, Skips, and Pops to arrive. Then the hot dogs quickly attack them and kidnap Benson, Pops, Skips, and Mordecai to be marinated in a giant plastic bag. The hot dog leader explains to Rigby that now the hot dogs did not want to be eaten; they wanted to eat them for "all of our fallen brother and sister hot dogs, massacred at the hand of your barbecue!" Rigby tries to escape the hot dogs, but fails to climb up a tree and is cornered. He eventually realizes that if he squirts mustard at them, they will eat each other. He does this to all of the hot dogs, and eventually they are taken care of. After all of this is said and done, Benson wants to know what happened, accusing Rigby. Rigby is able to place the blame on Benson, though, saying it was him who bought the "super premium psycho hot dogs" in the first place. Benson, embarrassed, quickly pulls out his wallet and tells Rigby to buy some more hot dogs at the store with Mordecai, and to make sure they''re regular.', 109, 8.6, 5, 1, '', 0, 'episodes/188401/2888831.jpg', 1304169299, 311571, 188401, 1334170697),

He also told them that the food is free for whoever works there (because he has worked there before). Then the two of them start eating all of the food, but by the end of the day they couldn''t take much more. Mordecai said that he needs to eat "something healthy, like a salad or something," but Rigby said that all they have to do is eat more and they will feel better, and proceeds to eats a fried shake that makes causes Mordecai to exclaim "aw, sick!" Rigby responds with the usual "hmph, hmph!" Back at the house, Mordecai eats a salad and says he feels much better, but Rigby continues to eat more junk food. Mordecai warns him that if he keeps on eating more junk food his body going to quit on him. Rigby ignores him, though, and tries to eat a doughnut. A title card appears that says "a split second later," and shows Rigby on the floor. He tries to eat the doughnut again, but his arms and body begin moving without his control, and proceed to pull his "consciousness" out of his raccoon body. Rigby''s consciousness looks like green slime, but with his eyes. Rigby begs his body to let him back in, but his body pushes him and runs away . When Rigby tries to chase it he lands in the trash bucket. The next morning Mordecai finds Rigby''s consciousness in the bucket; Rigby is still trying to convince Mordecai that he was right the whole time, and that eating more junk food really did help. Mordecai goes to Skips for help; Skips agrees to help (as usual), but says if they don''t find Rigby''s body and rejoin it before sunset, Rigby will be a body-less consciousness forever. Skips tells Rigby to stay put. After Mordecai and Skips leave, though, Rigby attaches a roller skate to his trash bucket, as a substitute for a body.\nSkips and Mordecai find Rigby''s body not too far away, eating a salad. Just when they are ready to ambush it, though, Rigby''s consciousness sneaks up behind them, scaring his body away. Mordecai gets angry, because he had told Rigby to stay put. After Skips and Mordecai left to continue to look for the body, Rigby decided he wanted some snacks. When he gets to the snack bar, he sees Muscle Man and High Five Ghost working, and demands snacks from them. Upon seeing the consciousness, Muscle man exclaims that this creature looks like a bucket of diarrhea. The two think the creature has stolen Rigby''s voice, and now wants their voices too. When Mordecai later asks Muscle Man and High Five Ghost if they seen Rigby, they say that they have seen a magic garbage can. Just at that moment, Mordecai realizes Rigby is being thrown into a garbage truck.\n\n\nInside the garbage truck Rigby meets another consciousness, who is in the form of a basketball. He tells Rigby that his body gave up on him for working out too hard. When Rigby tells the former bodybuilder that his body is still good, then he says if Rigby doesn''t want it, he''ll take it, and proceeds to runs off. Rigby tries to chase him, but trips, falls, and starts to cry. Just then, Mordecai finds Rigby. Rigby tells Mordecai that he was sorry for acting like a loser. He says that Mordecai was right and he was wrong, and begs him to help him get his body back. Mordecai agrees to help him, and says that even if they fail they always got the roller bucket. Mordecai contacts Skips via walkie talkie to let him know he found Rigby''s body. Skips says that is good, but to come ba ck quick, because that they have a problem. We see the former bodybuilder from before trying to lift weights in Rigby''s body, proceeding to slap Rigby''s body for being weak. Upon seeing him, Rigby demanded that he give him back his body, but the guy told him "finders keepers." "We tried it the nice way, now we do it, the Skips way," Skips told the bodybuilder, and the three begin to chase him. They eventually get on the the golf cart with Pops; Rigby jumps on the former bodybuilder and start to fight him, but then they both fall over the cliff. Rigby''s consciousness and the former bodybuilder both fight over the raccoon''s body. Eventually Rigby gets thrown onto Skips'' face, and Rigby''s body is hit with with the golf cart. This causes the bodybuilder''s consciousness to get ejected, and attach itself to a slide on a nearby playground, where a fat little boy proceeds to slide over him. "Aw, my mouth was open," the f ormer bodybuilder exclaimed. Rigby was happy he got his body back, but Mordecai asks him if he still wants it (because it got hit by the cart, and has a visible tire track over his back). Skips tells Rigby to that it''s almost sunset, and Rigby goes back to his tattered body. He rejoins with the body; when Mordecai asks him how he feels, and Rigby starts screaming. Rigby (now in a cast and a wheelchair) told Mordecai that he was right about the snack bar being lame now that they can''t eat the free snacks. But Mordecai tells him that the snacks where not free (it turned out that only Pops only gets the snacks for free) and that they have to work at the snack bar for 6 months for eating all the food, much to Rigby''s dismay.

Margaret hands them a flier for the open-mic night at the coffee shop where Margaret worked, and tells the two they should play at it. Wanting to impress Margaret, and so she doesn''t think they have a "stupid fake band," Mordecai tells her that he and Rigby will play at the show. Realizing that they donâ€™t know how to play, Mordecai and Rigby go to Pops for help, only to learn that he and everyone else from the park are also going to be attending the open-mic night. Pops gives Mordecai and Rigby three records to help them learn to play in time, but they are extremely dated, and less than helpful. To speed things up, Mordecai and Rigby try playing all three records at once. When a drink is spilled, however, this causes the record players to react with one another, resulting in Mordecai and Rigbyâ€™s future selves to appear (where it turns out they are both very successful musicians). The future selves teach Mordecai and Rigby the lyrics, the moves, and the looks, but never how to play.

On the way out, he bumps into the employee for the store outside. Rigby makes fun of his "outfit" (he is dressed as the empire state building, complete with a gorilla hanging from the top "antenna". This is a reference to King Kong). As Rigby walks away, the employee shouts "It''s a costume! They make me wear it!"\nBack at the park, it''s movie night for Mordecai and Rigby. Mordecai gets the popcorn and Rigby got the movie he rented. Mordecai thought that they were going to watch Shy Guy but Rigby told him that he has seen the movie a lot of times and he that he got something even better. He shows Mordecai the movie he rented called Ello Gov''nor. Rigby said that it''s a horror movie starring a taxi possessed by the driver''s soul seeking revenge on the gang members responsible for murdering him, which Mordecai refuses to watch and remined Rigby that the last time they watched a horror movie, he had to walk him to the bathroom for a week. Rigby is still not held back, saying that it''s black-and-white, and old and cheesy ("It''ll be hilarious!"). Mordecai finally gives in and turns on the movie, to which Rigby quickly grows fearful from the first encounter with the possessed taxi. When the movie ends, Mordecai is asleep, proclaiming the movie is likely cheesy, while Rigby is still in grave terror.\n\nThen in their room Mordecai is sleeping and Rigby is moving around and trying to sleep. Rigby gets up and goes to the window, and sees the British taxi. He calls Mordecai but he is still asleep and when Rigby turns around, he sees the taxi directly at the window. Rigby goes to Mordecai telling him to wake up while shaking him but it isn''t working. Then Mordecai''s eyes light up and the British taxi comes out of Mordecai. Rigby wakes up screaming, and Mordecai is bothered by Rigby''s shrieks, telling him to dream about being a tough guy. Then Rigby went back to sleep and dreams he is a tough guy called "Rigorson" about to punch a man in an alley when the British taxi comes in and hits Rigby. He wake ups shrieking again and Mordecai gets frustrated, retreating to watching Ello Gov''nor repeatedly until Rigby conquered his fear. He holds Rigby up to the TV for several days, telling him to "look at it [the British taxi]." By the end, they are both worn out, and Rigby finally escapes Mordecai''s grasp, and throws the tape of the movie at the wall, destroying it. Later, Mordecai takes Rigby to Benson''s cricket game to try to desensitize him to British people, but they all don''t stop greeting him with "Ello, gov''nor" until the British taxi appears yet again, causing Rigby to flee back home in a panic. Mordecai explains Rigby''s fear to Pops and Skips, to which Pops points out he owns a British taxi of his own...\nMordecai forces Rigby to watch "Ello Gov''nor" again\nAdded by Adaly026\nThen Mordecai, Rigby and Pops are at Pops'' barn. Rigby asks Mordecai what''s in the barn, and Mordecai tells him that it is something that will help get rid of his fear. Then Pops unlock the barn and show them his taxi (which turn out to be a regular taxi) then Mordecai told Pops that he thought that he had a British taxi but Pops said that he thought Mordecai said a "brownish" taxi but he said that taxi is yellow and Pops said that his taxi is no coward then Mordecai said "never mind". Then Mordecai asks Rigby if he is ready but Rigby is still scared but Mordecai said that it''s not even a British taxi but Rigby said a taxi is a taxi. Mordecai said that it''s going to be fine but Rigby said that he had to go to the bathroom.\nIn the bathroom Rigby is washing his hands and went to dry them with toilet paper and saw tire marks, then he ran out of the bathroom and the phone rings, he picks it up and the caller sounds like the British taxi and Rigby threw the phone and saw the fax machine that said ello gov''nor. Rigby ran and went in the back seat of the taxi and told Pops to drive and he did. Mordecai asks what''s wrong then Rigby said that the taxi is following him and Mordecai said that he is just seeing things but Rigby said that it WAS the British taxi and it was real then Mordecai sarcastically says it came out of the movie Rigby said "I DON''T KNOW MAYBE!" Mordecai said that he is safe now and said to try to calm down while Pops drives them around for a little bit.\n\nThe scene we see is Pops is driving straight and Mordecai is asleep and Rigby asks him where they were going then Pops said that he always drives deep into the woods to clear his mind. Then Rigby sees the trees making scary faces and the British taxi. Then the car stops because they ran out of gas then Rigby starts to get scared and calls Mordecai to wake up screaming (and Rigby screamed too) and said what is it then he said that they ran out of gas and the British taxi is coming for him and ducks into the taxi floor. Mordecai and Pops get out of the taxi and start to push then Rigby sees the British taxi coming and runs out of the taxi. Then Mordecai and Pops realize the taxi was real! And they start to run and the taxi got destroyed by the British Taxi that almost got Pops but Mordecai pulls him away and then they run to help Rigby. The British taxi was close to Rigby and he ran faster and the taxi surrounds him and made Rigby lean to a tree and Pops and Mordecai came but the taxi open both of the doors and knock them both unconscious. Then Rigby ran into a tree and just when the taxi is about to kill him, Rigby starts beating it up and demanded that the british taxi leaves him alone, then he woke up because Mordecai told him that he hit his head and started going psycho and Rigby told him that he got over his fear by beating up the taxi but it was actually the employee guy WEARING a British taxi costume and said he wanted the movie back but Rigby said that he broke so Pops pays for with a lollipop and Mordecai and Rigby drag Pops away.\n\nIn bed Rigby thanks Mordecai for helping him facing his fears and went to sleep dreaming that he is a tough guy driving the British taxi.', 201, 9, 3, 2, 'Sean Szeles, Shion Takeuchi', 0, 'episodes/188401/3411681.jpg', 1305655888, 386221, 188401, 1334170701),

They get their bedroom (which is empty at the time), and drink two cases of soda. They bring in a pile of old clothes, a blanket, a pillow, and an alarm clock.

But it happened, and the black hole was gone. Rigby saw only half the chair, so he said "Cool" and called it. Benson then said that Mordecai and Rigby had to flip over the overturned golf cart, throw away the half chair, and clean up that mess "OR YOU''RE FIRED!!!!!!!!!!", turning red at the previous quote, Then Mordecai & Rigby promises not to screw up the next day, after that Rigby plays Rock, Paper, Scissors again with Mordecai to pick up the cart, Then the screen goes blank.', 0, 9.5, 2, 2, '', 0, 'episodes/188401/4130777.jpg', 1310615282, 386221, 188401, 1334170715),

They find that she was earlier married to Dr. Malcolm Truss a former Massive Dynamic biochemical researcher, and believe her murder was an attempt to access his aborted research on cell cloning by one of the new shape shifters, Nadine, previously seen in "Neither Here Nor There". While at Massive Dynamic, it is revealed that Nina Sharp raised Olivia and her sister after Olivia killed her stepfather and ran away from Walter''s Cortexiphan trials. Walter resents Nina for both this and for her interference that led to young Peter''s death. Fringe is unable to locate Truss before Nadine does, and place a manhunt to track him down. Meanwhile, Nadine has tried to convince Truss that she is a patient in need of his cloning research, and coerces him to take her to his unmarked laboratory to synthesis the cure. It''s revealed she has a daughter, Haley.\n\nAs Fringe division attempts to work out Truss'' location, Peter, from his cell, uses the intercom electronics to try to convince Olivia and the others that he knows about shape shifter technology. Under guard, Peter is able to use one of the memory discs previously recovered by Fringe to identify a tracking signal allowing Fringe to set off to Truss'' laboratory. Truss has come to discover Nadine''s truth after she temporarily loses control and takes the form of his former wife, but under threat of death, continues to synthesize the cure.\n\nTruss finishes the cure just as the FBI and Fringe division surround the warehouse containing the lab. After being given the cure, Nadine attempts to fight off the agents, but appears to have dived into the water below. On recovering a body from the water, they realize that Nadine had taken the place of a fallen agent and has escaped their grasp. Nadine uses a Hermes 3000 typewriter stored in a locker at a Boston train station to type a report informing them of the success of Truss'' cure; moments later, the typewriter, on its own, types out further instructions for her.\n\nWalter, after trying to resolve his issues with Peter, returns to Fringe to inform Peter that he had two chances to save his son and let him down both times, he will not try to help again for fear of doing more harm.

The same unwinnable war".', 79744, 90, 'graphical/176941-g.jpg', 'fanart/original/176941-9.jpg', 1334092769, 'posters/176941-5.jpg', 'Sunday', 9.4, 129, 'Continuing', '2010-07-20', 1335288560),
